# Stabilization execution prompt (post-extraction continuation)

Re-runnable. Written 2026-07-16, after the QML extraction initiative
completed. Give this file to a fresh session to drive the remaining
work in priority order. It assumes CLAUDE.md has been read (the
working agreements, root-cause law, regression discipline, copyright
rules, code-clarity laws and Q_ASSERT truths there are binding and are
not repeated here).

## Standing context

- Repo: ~/Projects/latte-dock, GitHub whimbree/lattecotta-dock
  (project name Lattecotta Dock; binary/D-Bus names stay latte).
- docs/PORTING_PLAN.md is the tracker: its "Where we are" section
  carries the ranked high-priority list; every task is a checkbox with
  a Commits: line - tick and fill as you land work.
- docs/QML_EXTRACTION_PLAN.md is COMPLETE; its ledger's executed notes
  name the still-owed live-verification recipes. Do not reopen units;
  new cores follow the same step-2.5 law (sanitized unit tests via
  latte_add_unit_test, QT_FORCE_ASSERTS, type discipline, qmllint
  ratchet strict-on-touch, coverage-ratchet pairing).
- Gates before any merge: full ctest green, scripts/coverage-ratchet.sh,
  scripts/qmllint-gate.sh (baseline only shrinks), both WITH_X11
  variants build. Use `nix develop -c` for all build/test commands.
- Live verification on the author's real Wayland session is authorized.
  Tools: scripts/restart-staged.sh (-d for the throwaway profile,
  --user-config for the real one - ALWAYS restore --user-config when
  done), ~/.local/bin/fakepointer (glide in small steps, never
  jump-click; scroll takes detents+gap), scripts/tools/dumpwins.sh,
  spectacle -b -n, KWin scripting via busctl for window manipulation,
  kwriteconfig6 against the throwaway layout for config flips (edit
  while the dock is STOPPED, then restart).
- Parallel work: spawn worktree subagents per unit of work where tasks
  are disjoint; the orchestrator merges serially (rebase onto master,
  ff-merge, full gates, live checks, ledger/plan tick, push, prune).
  Merge lessons already paid for: tests/units/CMakeLists.txt and
  plugin-registration files are both-append unions; tests/ratchet-
  baseline count = union size with a sorted entry list; tests/qmllint-
  baseline is taken from ours then REGENERATED with --write-baseline
  after a full build; plugins.qmltypes is NEVER hand-merged - always
  regenerate with the qmlplugindump recipe in the file's own header
  against the freshly staged tree, and verify every expected singleton
  name appears before committing.
- Push after each landed, verified chunk. Prefer new commits over
  amending. Conventional commits with root-cause bodies.

## Priority order

Work top to bottom. Each item names its home in docs/PORTING_PLAN.md;
read the full checklist item there before starting - this list is the
map, not the territory.

0. **Land the round-3 icon set** (branding, quick): candidate 9
   ("parabolic latte wave", ~/Projects/latte-dock/logo-candidates-round3/
   candidate-9.svg) becomes the app icon: derive the six size variants
   in icons/ (16/22/24/32/48/sc), simplifying per size the way the
   round-1 landing did (drop detail that smears at 16px; the
   candidate's own -16.png render is the fidelity reference), and
   candidate 12 ("the wave, poured") becomes the README logo.png at
   128px. Keep SPDX lines (Bree Spektor + Latte Dock contributors).
   Verify legibility with rsvg-convert renders at every size before
   committing.

1. **Session shutdown/logout teardown** (Phase 8): one deliberate
   sequence; unload the Corona's dependents in explicit dependency
   order. This is the crash-on-logout class. Instrument a real
   logout/login cycle on the throwaway session before and after.

2. **Startup latency + retry-exhaustion deadlock** (Phase 8): measure
   first (the plan item records the live observation), fix the
   deadlock, then attack latency with evidence.

3. **Dock visibility across screen lock/unlock** (Phase 8): reproduce
   with loginctl lock-session/unlock-session on the throwaway.

4. **Cloned-view applet-order sync** (Phase 8): the deferred-sync gap
   (a clone's containment can finish initializing before
   structuralSyncReady() is true and nothing re-triggers). Fix is
   described in the item. Also the prerequisite for the Replicate Dock
   continuation feature (docs/dock-replication-design.md).

5. **Edit-mode polish cluster** (Phase 7): entry/exit detection
   research FIRST (read the phase notes - a reference fork needed 8+
   attempts), then drag-reorder jitter, double-click widget add,
   position-aware drop insertion, icons-stuck-behind-close-overlay.

6. **Layer-shell struts/exclusive-zone + kde_output_order_v1** (Phase
   4): align with what Plasma itself uses; regression-test multi-
   screen placement with dumpwins after every change.

7. **Settings-window control audit** (Phase 8): every control on every
   page against Qt5 semantics; the Tasks-config lesson (a page that
   renders but silently does nothing) is the failure mode to hunt.

8. **The accessibility/automation quartet** (Phase 10 requirements
   subsection - read it in full; these are requirements, not polish):
   a. Keyboard navigation for EVERYTHING (audit surface-by-surface,
      written shortcut map, focus order + visible indicators).
   b. D-Bus exposure for e2e testability (one reviewed interface
      design; anything a test needs to drive or inspect gets a
      surface; state readbacks replace pixel-peeping).
   c. Convert nondeterministic e2e tests to deterministic ones (live
      cursor ONLY where pointer delivery is itself under test - those
      keep fakepointer).
   d. Full AT-SPI support (Accessible roles/names on every interactive
      item, focus events, Orca pass as acceptance). Do b before c;
      a and d together (they share the focus/role work).

9. **Hosted CI + microvm GUI e2e harness** (Phase 10): the local gates
   are pure shell over cmake/ctest; stand up the pipeline, then the
   microvm compositor harness for the pointer-delivery tests.

10. **The tail**: extraction ledger live-verification leftovers (each
    executed note names its recipes; two need the author's hands:
    Meta+number badges, real file drags), known-bug-list sweep,
    WindowId newtype hardening, stuck-overlay and uninvoked-config
    findings, Phase 9 color-group audit, Phases 2/3 mechanical tail.

## Session protocol

Operate autonomously with a long horizon. For each item: read the plan
item and its phase notes, design before code, tests first where a core
is touched, land in small bisectable commits, run the gates, live-verify
against the running dock (throwaway first, real config for the final
check when the change is user-visible), tick the plan checkbox with
commit hashes, push, and keep docs/session-handoff.md current so an
interruption loses nothing. When a live check finds a defect, stop and
root-cause it before continuing the checklist - found defects outrank
planned work. Flag anything needing the author's physical input and
move on rather than blocking.
