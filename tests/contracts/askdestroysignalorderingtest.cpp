//! Upstream contract (tests/contracts/README.md): libplasma askDestroy()
//! signal ordering at the pinned v6.7.3, earned in 71b0d75a where the System
//! Tray's ghost slot lived exactly as long as the undo window.
//!
//! askDestroy() - the widget-removal entry point behind every applet's
//! "remove" action - marks the applet destroyed() and keeps the OBJECT alive
//! for the undo notification (60s fallback timer). Latte's containment
//! LayoutManager keys its two-phase parking on exactly this timeline, which
//! since 6.7 is the SAME for every applet class:
//!
//! destroyedChanged(true) first, then Containment::appletRemoved fires
//! IMMEDIATELY (synchronously inside askDestroy) with the applet pruned from
//! Containment::applets(), and fires a SECOND time when the object really
//! dies (~Applet emits appletDeleted, which the containment re-broadcasts as
//! appletRemoved - unconditionally, list membership does not gate it).
//! removeAppletItem must treat destroyed()==true as "park, undo still
//! possible" both times. Undo re-inserts into applets() and re-emits
//! appletAdded; addAppletItem tolerates arriving after the destruction
//! watcher already unparked (its "reaches here twice" guard).
//!
//! HISTORY - the 6.6.5 contract this test originally pinned: askDestroy()
//! guarded the immediate emit AND the list removal with !isContainment(),
//! so a containment-type applet (the System Tray is a Plasma::Containment
//! of type CustomEmbedded) got NO immediate appletRemoved, stayed in
//! applets() for the whole undo window, and its ONLY appletRemoved arrived
//! at object death. libplasma 6.7 widened the guard to
//! `containment() && containment() != q` (both in askDestroy's tail and in
//! the undo re-add), so CustomEmbedded trays now follow the plain-applet
//! ordering exactly. Latte's parking survives the change by construction -
//! setAppletInScheduledDestruction is idempotent per id in both directions,
//! and the AppletItem.qml destruction watcher (which parks on
//! destroyedChanged and is now redundant-but-first for parking) remains the
//! unpark-before-appletAdded ordering guarantee on undo. Caught by this
//! test at the 2026-07-17 re-pin.
//!
//! The undo window's end is simulated with a direct delete: the real timer
//! path (AppletPrivate::cleanUpAndDelete) ends in deleteLater() on the same
//! object, and the appletRemoved-at-death emission under test lives in
//! ~Applet -> appletDeleted -> ContainmentPrivate::appletDeleted, which both
//! paths share.
//!
//! Constructed offscreen: Plasma::Corona, Plasma::Containment and
//! Plasma::Applet all have public constructors; the applet id rides in
//! args[1]. The Corona is not optional decoration: Applet::isContainment()
//! is true only for a Containment whose parent IS a Corona (or one of type
//! CustomEmbedded), and both the askDestroy() emit guard and
//! Containment::init() key off it. askDestroy() is a Q_PRIVATE_SLOT,
//! reachable through the metaobject exactly as the remove QAction reaches
//! it.
