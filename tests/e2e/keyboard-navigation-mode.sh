# E2E: keyboard focus mode lifecycle over D-Bus in the nested vehicle -
# enter/exit readback (viewsData keyboardNavigation), unknown-id refusal,
# and the bulletproof focus-loss exit: with the mode on, a client window
# mapping in the compositor takes the keyboard focus and the mode must
# fall back to off ON ITS OWN (a dock stuck focusable breaks every
# fullscreen application - that is the defect class this pins).
# e2e-mode: nested-only
#
# Unlike the sibling e2e scripts this one is self-contained: it starts
# its own staged dock against a throwaway config copy, so it must run
# inside the nested vehicle with a PRIVATE bus (the dock exits instantly
# on the KDBusService unique name otherwise - the documented trap):
#
#   nix develop -c tests/sceneprobe/run_in_kwin.sh dbus-run-session -- \
#       tests/e2e/keyboard-navigation-mode.sh
#
# The focus-taker is a minimal QML window, not konsole: konsole's cold
# start inside the nested session exceeded every reasonable wait and the
# focus-loss leg timed out on it (caught 2026-07-17 while landing the
# mode; the qml window maps in about a second).
